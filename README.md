Weather App- Project Outline

1.) Project Description:
Weather App is intended for moblie based weather alerts and condtions to help users understand more about the current condtions and to ensure they are prepared for any possible weather while they are out. The application shoudl be able to help users stay safe, well informed and get straight to the point of the current condtions ongoing right now.
The core value of the app is to alert and automatically fetch and display real time weather data while being able to serve location based weather alerts along with any personlization recommendations fot the UI for the consumer.

2.) Target Audience:
Anuyone who wants quick, reliable, and easy-to-read weather information. This can range from students, commuters, teavelers, and everyday people from around the U.S.

3.) Project Scope:
Focusing on city search, current weather conditions, 5-day forecasts, outfit recommendations, and basic account changes and customizations. Updates later down the road can include furhter quiality of life imporvments within the app and include widgets and other applications that users can implement later on.

Problem Addressing:

1.) Market Context:
There are a ton of apps out there that offer the weather and information that they would need to ensure proper data and other information that users can benifit from but a lot of these apps can come with ads or features that might not be useful for everyone, being able to take them off and change the informaiton but also still being able to achieve the apps intended idea. Users with needs for the weather such as what the temps will be or what they need to wear or bring with during thier day could help out. The less the better, but if someone wants to add those features they should be able to be as they see fit.

2.) Solution Impact:
Provide a clean, personalized weather data at a glance without too many distractions. Notify the users of severe weather via notifications for areas they might have saved or activtley living in with the location based. The outfit recommendation will translate weather data into actioable advice for the user so they can plan out accordingly.

Platform:

---

1.) Development Enviorment
Android Studio (latest stable version) as the primary IDE. Language: Kotlin (preferred) with ViewBinding and XML layouts for the UI layer.

2.). Deployment & Ecosystem
Google Play Store distribution. Backend and services remain inside the Google ecosystem for seamless integration and security.

3.) Target Devices
Android 8.0 (API 26) and above. Optimized for both phones and tablets (adaptive layouts).

 Front/Back End Support:

1.) Frontend Architecture
Native Android app built in Android Studio. XML layouts with ViewBinding for all screens. Room database for offline-first weather caching so the app remains functional without an internet connection. Retrofit handles all API communication and Glide handles weather icon loading.

2.) Backend Architecture
The unified backend platform is Google Firebase:
- Firebase Authentication – user accounts, email/password, Google Sign-In
- Cloud Firestore – secure storage of saved city profiles and user preferences
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) – real-time push notifications for severe weather alerts
- Firebase Functions – optional serverless triggers for periodic weather refresh and alert scanning

3.) Integration & Security
All data encrypted in transit and at rest (Firebase default). API keys stored securely in local.properties and never committed to version control. No third-party backend services outside the Google ecosystem.
